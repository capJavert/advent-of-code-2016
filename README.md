# Advent of Code 2016

### Update #9 Happy New Year!! Didn't quite make it with rest of the challenges, just a couple of stars off, maybe sometimes in this new year.. maybe ??

### Update #8 Merry Xmas!! I was kinda busy last to days so i did not managed to to finish last two days of challenge (too busy decorating xmas tree).. I will try to finish everything until the end of the year :)

### Update #7: Finished part 1 of day 17 challenge, did it on manual with shell game similar to day 11.. part 2 requires longest path so i think ill have to make a bot for it after all, gonna be something new for me :/

### Update #6: Finished Day 11 challenge too (game did help a lot) and now I am on course again!!

### Update #5: Day 11 challenge is kinda killing me and I figured I will rather make a game for it. So I implemented simple shell game with all the rules from the challenge.. Can you beat it in minimum number of steps and send it to me pls? :P

### Update #4: Finished day 10 challenge.. really messed it up :P, this weekend was super busy so I am late for day 11 and 12 challenges I'll try to solve them and get back on track again as soon as I can..

### Update #3: Finished day 9 challenge, execution time of my script for part 2 was 3738 sec ~ 1 hour ... just lool but well i had time :)

### Update #2: Finished challenge for day 7 rather easy.. I will try to keep solving challenges on day by day basis from now on.

### Update #1: After several hours managed to catch up and finish all 6 available challenges.. waiting for day 7 challenge! So lets goo!

### Joining little bit late, I will try to solve every challenge till 25th December 2016
