# Advent of Code 2016

###Update #6: Finished Day 11 challenge too (game did help a lot) and now I am on course again!!

###Update #5: Day 11 challenge is kinda killing me and I figured I will rather make a game for it. So I implemented simple shell game with all the rules from the challenge.. Can you beat it in minimum number of steps and send it to me pls? :P

###Update #4: Finished day 10 challenge.. really messed it up :P, this weekend was super busy so I am late for day 11 and 12 challenges I'll try to solve them and get back on track again as soon as I can..

###Update #3: Finished day 9 challenge, execution time of my script for part 2 was 3738 sec ~ 1 hour ... just lool but well i had time :)

###Update #2: Finished challenge for day 7 rather easy.. I will try to keep solving challenges on day by day basis from now on.

###Update #1: After several hours managed to catch up and finish all 6 available challenges.. waiting for day 7 challenge! So lets goo!

###Joining little bit late, I will try to solve every challenge till 25th December 2016
